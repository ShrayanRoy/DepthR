# Introduction

* Humans possess a natural ability to perceive *3D structure* from 2D images.

* Primarily relying on *visual cues* such as perspective, relative object sizes.

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure: 3D perspective from 2D image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Depth: the third dimension

* Traditional photographs are two dimensional projections of a three dimensional scene.

* The third dimension is **depth**, which represents the distance between camera and objects in the image.

* Estimating depth of an image has interesting applications such as post-capture image refocusing and automatic scene segmentation.

--

* Most approaches involve **multiple images** of same scene or **hardware based solutions** like light emitters and coded apertures.

--

* Depth estimation from single image is more challenging, as we have only one observation per pixel.

* In this project we aim to estimate depth given a single image of the scene.

---

# Depth from Defocus

* Depth estimation from defocus blur exploits the phenomenon where objects appear more blurred depending on their distance from the camera lens.

* Measuring level of blur for each pixel can be used as a *surrogate* for depth.

&lt;img src="pimg/depfoc.png" alt="Figure: Bluriness depending on distance from camera" width="44%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure: Bluriness depending on distance from camera&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Levin et al. (2007)

* Levin et al. utilized this idea to estimate level of blur for each pixel.

* They used *sparse gradient prior* on natural images.

* But it requires a modified camera with a special coded aperture.


&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="pimg/levin.png" alt="Figure: Levin et al. 2007 - Image and Depth from a Conventional Camera with a Coded Aperture" width="75%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure: Levin et al. 2007 - Image and Depth from a Conventional Camera with a Coded Aperture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Zhu et al. (2013)

* Zhu et al. employed same idea using Gabor filters for local frequency component analysis.

* But they have used *simple gradient prior* on natural images.

* Their method does not require special coded aperture.

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure: Zhu et al. 2013 - Estimating Spatially Varying Defocus Blur from A Single Image&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Our Approach: Main Idea

* Use of more **general prior** for image proposed by Nandy (2021).

--

* Parametric models to estimate level of blur as surrogate for depth.

--

* Instead of doing post estimation segmentation, start with pre-segmented image.

* Estimate blur (depth) for each segment separately.

* Use of Modern segmentation algorithms such as **Segment-Anything**.

---

# Point Spread Function

* When light rays spread from a point source and hit the camera lens, they should ideally refract and converge on the corresponding pixel of the original scene.

* However, if the source is out of focus, the refracted rays spread out over neighboring pixels as well.

--

* This spreading pattern is called the Point Spread Function (PSF) or Blur Kernel.

--

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="pimg/psfimg.png" alt="Figure: Point Spread Function" width="65%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure: Point Spread Function&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Model for Blurred Image

* The blurred image can be viewed as **convolution** of original sharp image and Point Spread Function. 

* The observed blurred image `\(\boldsymbol{b}\)` of dimension `\(M \times N\)` can be modeled as - 

  `$$\boldsymbol{b} = \boldsymbol{k} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{l} \ + \ \boldsymbol{\epsilon}$$`
Where,

  * `\(\boldsymbol{k}\)` is an `\(m \times n\)` PSF / blur kernel.
  
  * `\(\boldsymbol{l}\)` is the `\((M + m) \times (N + n)\)` *true latent image* which we want to estimate.
  
  * `\(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\)` is an `\(M \times N\)` matrix of noise.
  
  * `\(\otimes\)` denotes the *valid convolution* operator.

--

* Estimating both `\(\boldsymbol{l}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{k}\)` using above model is called *blind deconvolution problem*.

--

* Number of observations `\(MN\)` is very large compared number of parameters `\(\implies\)` **ill-posed problem** 

--

* Can use some prior on `\(\boldsymbol{l}\)` to deal with this ? 

---

# Model for Blurred Image


* The model defined in last slide assumes that PSF is *shift invariant* i.e. same PSF applies to all pixels.

--

* In the context of defocus blur, PSF/ Blur Kernel is *spatially varying*.

--

* We assume that `\(\boldsymbol{k_t}\)` is shift invariant in a neighborhood `\({\boldsymbol{\eta_t}}\)` of size `\(p_1(\boldsymbol{t}) \times p_2(\boldsymbol{t})\)` containing `\(\boldsymbol{t}\)`.

* Based on this assumption, our model for *spatially varying blur* is given by - 

  `$$\boldsymbol{y[t']} = (\boldsymbol{k_t} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{x})\boldsymbol{[t']} \ + \ \boldsymbol{n[t']} \ \ \ \forall \boldsymbol{t'} \in \boldsymbol{\eta_t}$$`
Where, 

  * `\([t']\)` indicates the elements at pixel location `\(\boldsymbol{t'}\)`.
  
  * `\(\boldsymbol{k_t}\)` is the spatially varying PSF at pixel location `\(\boldsymbol{t}\)`.

--
  
* We need to estimate `\(\boldsymbol{k_t}\)` for each pixel location `\(\boldsymbol{t}\)` `\(\implies\)` more ill-posed !

--

* We will use parametric models with a small number of parameters.

---

# Proposed Parametric Models for Blur Kernel

* In the case of blurring due to defocus, shape of the blur kernel is **circular** and controls the level of blur.

--

* **Uniform distribution** across a circular are defined by the radius of the circle, denoted by `\(r\)`.

`$$k(x,y) = \frac{1}{\pi r^2} \times \text{I}_{\{x^2 + y^2 \ \leq \ r^2\}}$$`
--

* **Gaussian distribution** across a circular area defined by the radius of the circle, denoted as `\(r\)`, and the scale parameter, represented as `\(h\)`.

`$$k(x,y) = \frac{C_{h,r}}{2\pi h^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2h^2}} \times \text{I}_{\{x^2 + y^2 \ \leq \ r^2\}}$$`
--

* **Cauchy distribution** across a circular area defined by the radius of the circle, denoted as `\(r\)`, and the scale parameter `\(h\)`.

  `$$k(x,y) = \frac{C_{h,r}}{2\pi}\frac{h}{(x^2 + y^2 + h^2)^{3/2}}\times \text{I}_{\{x^2 + y^2 \ \leq \ r^2\}}$$`


---

# Prior on Natural Images

* By **natural**, we refer to typical scenes captured in amateur digital photography, excluding specialized contexts like astronomy or satellite imaging.

--

* The prior family used is motivated from the observation that the distribution of image gradients have a **sharp peak near zero** and and relatively **heavier tails** than the Gaussian distribution and Laplace distribution.

&lt;div class="figure" style="text-align: center"&gt;
&lt;img src="pimg/prior1.png" alt="Figure: Eight sharp images and their density plot of horizontal gradients" width="75%" height="30%" /&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Figure: Eight sharp images and their density plot of horizontal gradients&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Prior on Natural Images

* A useful parametric family to model this is the so called **Hyper-Laplacian Distribution** given by 

`$$f_{\alpha}(z) = \frac{\alpha}{2\Gamma(\frac{1}{\alpha})}\text{exp}{(-|z|^{\alpha})}, z \in \mathbb{R} \ \ \text{and} \ \ \alpha &gt; 0$$`

* Levin et al. used `\(\alpha = 0.8\)` and Zhu et al. used `\(\alpha = 2\)`  with IID assumption of image gradients.

--

* Nandy (2021) showed that assumption of independent gradients is incorrect and suggested *simple AR process* to model it.

--

* To use these priors we express the blur model in-terms of image gradients in frequency domain.

`$$\boldsymbol{\delta_h}\otimes\boldsymbol{b} = \boldsymbol{\delta_h} \otimes(\boldsymbol{k} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{l}) \ + \ (\boldsymbol{\delta_h}\otimes \boldsymbol{\epsilon}) =  k \otimes(\boldsymbol{\delta_h} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{l}) \ + \ (\boldsymbol{\delta_h}\otimes \boldsymbol{\epsilon})$$`
`$$\boldsymbol{\delta_v}\otimes\boldsymbol{b} = \boldsymbol{\delta_v} \otimes(\boldsymbol{k} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{l}) \ + \ (\boldsymbol{\delta_v}\otimes \boldsymbol{\epsilon}) =  k \otimes(\boldsymbol{\delta_v} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{l}) \ + \ (\boldsymbol{\delta_v}\otimes \boldsymbol{\epsilon})$$`
--

* We will use a generic form of these equations, given by

`$$\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{k} \ \otimes \ \boldsymbol{x} \ + \ \boldsymbol{n}$$`

---

# Prior on Natural Images(Contd.)

* Using Convolution Theorem for *Discrete Fourier Transform* we have

`$$\boldsymbol{Y} = \boldsymbol{K} \odot \boldsymbol{X} + \boldsymbol{N}$$`
`\(\ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \text{}\)` Where, `\(\boldsymbol{Y,K,X}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{N}\)` are the *Discrete Fourier Transform*'s of `\(\boldsymbol{y,k,x}\)` and `\(\boldsymbol{n}\)` respectively.

--

* Then, `\(\forall \ \boldsymbol{\omega} = (\omega_1,\omega_2)\)` we have `\(\boldsymbol{Y_{\omega} = K_{\omega}X_{\omega} + N_{\omega}}\)`

--

* Nandy (2021) defined the prior on DFT coefficients as -

  * `\(X_{\omega}\)`'s are independently distributed and follow the complex normal distribution `\(\mathcal{CN}(0,\sigma^2 g_{\omega})\)` exactly or asymptotically, depending on whether `\(\alpha = 2\)` or not.
  
  * Simple AR process is used to model the dependence structure of latent image gradients, i.e. `\(\rho(\boldsymbol{x_{ij},x_{kl}}) = {\rho_1}^{|i-k|}{\rho_2}^{|j-l|}\)`. 
  
  * Under these assumptions `\(g_{\omega}\)` can be calculated explicitly.

--
  
* Note that the above is for uniform blur model.  

---

# Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Blur Kernel Parameters

* To estimate blur kernel parameters `\(\theta = (r,h)\)` or `\(r\)`, we will use maximum likelihood procedure.

--

* If we assume that `\(N_{\omega} \sim \mathcal{CN}(0,\eta^2 h_{\omega})\)` for all `\(\omega\)`. Then `\(|\boldsymbol{Y_{\omega}}|^2 \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_\omega = \frac{1}{\sigma^2|K_\omega|^2 g_{\omega} + \eta^2 h_{\omega}}) \ \ \ \forall \omega\)`

--

* The joint pdf of `\(|\boldsymbol{Y_{\omega}}|^2\)`'s is given by

`$$f_{\theta}(|Y_{\omega}|^2,\forall \omega) = \prod_{\omega} f_{\theta,\omega}(|Y_{\omega}|^2)$$`
`\(\ \ \  \ \ \ \ \ \text{}\)`  Where, `\(f_{\theta,\omega}(.)\)` denotes the pdf of `\(\text{Exp}(\lambda_\omega = \frac{1}{\sigma^2|K_\omega|^2 g_{\omega} + \eta^2 h_{\omega}})\)`.

--

* Assuming independence of vertical and horizontal gradients, the joint likelihood is given by

`$$L(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = L_h(\boldsymbol{\theta})\times L_v(\boldsymbol{\theta}) = f_{\theta}(|Y_{h,\omega}|^2,\forall \omega) \times f_{\theta}(|Y_{v,\omega'}|^2,\forall \omega')$$`

--

* Our objective is to find

`$$\hat{\theta} = \underset{\boldsymbol{\theta}}{\text{argmax}} \ \log L(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\theta}}) = \underset{\theta}{\text{argmax}} \ \ \{\log L_h(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \log L_v(\boldsymbol{\theta})\}$$`

---

# Challenges in ML Estimation


* Parameter `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)` is involved in the expression `\(\lambda_{\omega}\)` through `\(|\boldsymbol{K_{\omega}}|^2\)`, which is a complicated function of `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)`.

--

* Thus, before we start using any optimization technique, we empirically investigate the behavior of `\(L(\boldsymbol{\theta})\)` as a function of `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)`.

--

* Simulated experiments using disc kernel are conducted for this purpose.

* We consider a sequence of values for `\(r \in [1,4]\)` with `\(\Delta{r} = 0.05\)`, and for `\(\sigma \in [0.01,0.4]\)` with `\(\Delta{\sigma} = 0.01\)`, with `\(\eta = 0.001\)` constant.

--

* We use a numerical optimization approach, explicitly calculating `\(|\boldsymbol{K_{\omega}}|^2\)` as a function of `\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\)`.

&lt;/div&gt;

# Challenges in ML Estimation

* Global maxima don't always correspond to the actual parameters of the blur kernel.

--

* Poor estimation of blur kernel can lead to artifacts.

&lt;/div&gt;

# Challenges in ML Estimation

* The choice of the prior parameter `\(\sigma\)` is playing an important role.

--

* One reasonable option is to fix a value of `\(\sigma\)`.

--

* Simulation study can be used to find a reasonable value of `\(\sigma\)`.

--

* We consider five sharp images and true parameter values `\(r_{true} = 1, 3, 5\)`.
  
* For each value of `\(r_{true}\)`, patches of fixed size are randomly selected, and defocus blur is simulated.

* `\(\hat{r}\)` is determined as a function of `\(\sigma\)` in each case and plotted.

--

* From that `\(\sigma = 0.2\)` seems to be a reasonable choice.

---

&lt;/div&gt;

---

# Towards Image Segementation

* Instead of manually selecting patches, we require a more general method.

* Selecting overlapping local patches for each pixel can be useful.

--

* But it may yield poor results in certain situations.

--

* We will use segments obtained by the segmentation algorithm.

# Segment Anything

* It has both manual and automatic method to perform segmentation.

* It can take **prompts** such as - box, points, texts as input to perform segmentation.

# Future Work

* Perform more simulations involving other types of blur kernels.

--

* Conduct empirical analysis to understand which blur kernel model is applicable.

--

* Evaluate how our method performs for the image segments identified by the segmentation algorithm.

--

* Use our method to find depth map given a single image.

--

* Attempt to use this method for tasks like post-capture image refocusing.

# Appendix

.panelset[
.panel[.panel-name[Thin Lens Model]

* From a single point source, light rays emit in different directions and fall on the lens of camera.

* The lens bends light to form a circle on the camera sensor. It's called the *Blur Circle* or *Circle of Confusion*.

* There is a relation between circle of confusion and depth of object in an image.

`$$c_{diam} = a_{diam}f \left|\frac{d - d_{focus}}{d(d_{focus} - f)}\right| \approx a_{diam}f \left|\frac{1}{d_{focus}} - \frac{1}{d}\right|$$`

* In a given camera settings, `\(c_{diam} \propto \left|\frac{1}{d_{focus}} - \frac{1}{d}\right|\)` 

* For different values of `\(d\)`, we can have `\(\left|\frac{1}{d_{focus}} - \frac{1}{d}\right|\)` same `\(\implies\)` ill possed problem !
